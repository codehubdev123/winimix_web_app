2 - dialogs live in @/components/alerts/
3- make CreateForm insted of CreateCategoryForm  because i need make same name for all my features 
4 - make EditForm insted of EditCategoryForm i need make same name for all my features  same for showPage  NAME IT AS ShowPage and for list ListPage
5 - make sure CtaeogryTable component called Table because i need name it as table
